**Design 2: Bernice Tran**
	![alt text][design2]

	Pros:
		1. Components broken down well; I like the way GroceryItem/Type are related to the database Search class -Naz
		2. Includes possible classes that MIGHT be necessary despite not being mentioned in the spec (such as GLType, and a ListManagement Class) -Naz
		3. [List Pros Here]
	Cons:
		1. Not sure how necessary the extra classes are, for example GLType - can that not be an attribute for the GroceryList class? -Naz
		2. [List Cons Here]

**Design 3: Jooyong "Daniel" Park**

	Pros:
		1. I really like the way your design is structured in a sort of top -> down style, it makes reading and following the connections easier -Naz
		2. Also like the way features are broken down, similarly to Bernice's where the Monthly/Weekly list features are separate -Naz
		3. [List Pros Here]
	Cons:
		1. I'm not sure how the user is tied to everything in this design, are we saying the User is not the one with the ability to Change/Add/Delete what's in the List? -Naz
		2. [List Cons Here]

**Design 4: Ricardo Delahoz**

	Pros:
		1. Components are broken down neatly with each class having understandable attributes and methods -Naz
		2. Also takes into account possible things that are not in the specs like GroceryStore (which might also be treated as a con) -Naz 
	Cons:
		1. I might be misinterpreting some stuff here, namely the necessity of the GroceryStore class - this wasn't mentioned in the specs, unless we're treating this as the Database. It makes logical sense, but do you guys think this is necessary for the design? -Naz
		2. I'm also not sure about the Address class either, if we take out the GroceryStore class then this would likely go away as well; likewise, is it necessary to have User and Customer as separate classes? What other users would there be? Let's talk about this more later -Naz
