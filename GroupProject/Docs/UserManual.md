### How to use your "Grocery List Manager" App:
1. Welcome to your Grocery List Manager (GLM)! Upon opening the app, you should be greeted
by a blank screen; that's normal!

2. Take notice of the "+" symbol in the top right hand corner - by tapping this, you can
create and add a new list to your GLM and start filling up some of that blank space.

3. Once you've created a list (or 10), you can do one of two things - tap a list to select it,
or press and hold a list.

4. Pressing and holding a list will open up an options menu to let you:

 * "Rename" your list
 * "Delete" your list

5. Tapping a list will let you enter that list's Item menu.

6. The Item menu shows a search bar and another "+" to let you add items to your list -
 for a newly created list, it should be empty and quite blank, so add lots of items!

7. Write the name of the item you want to add to your list and then press the "+" symbol
 to add that item to the list - if it's not an item that can be recognized, you can add it
 to our database for future reference!

8. Once you've added an item to your list, a checkbox appears to the left of the item, while
 a number appears on the right side - this lets you adjust how many of that item you'd like.

9. If you're out shopping and you've gotten the item you want, you can tap a checkbox to mark it.

10. If you think you don't need an item after making the list, that's fine too! Just press and
 hold the item's name and select the "Delete" option - OR reduce the quantity number to 0.

11. If you want to check a different list, simply tap your mobile device's corresponding "back"
 key and you'll be back at the main menu screen.
