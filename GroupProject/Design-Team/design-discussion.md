**Design 2: Bernice Tran**
	![alt text][design2]

	Pros:
		1. Components broken down well; I like the way GroceryItem/Type are related to the database Search class -Naz

		3. [List Pros Here]
	Cons:
		1. Not sure how necessary the extra classes are, for example GLType - can that not be an attribute for the GroceryList class? -Naz
		2. [List Cons Here]
