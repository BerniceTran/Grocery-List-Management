# Project Plan

**Author**: \<Nazib Mondal, Ricardo Delahoz, Bernice Tran, Jooyong Park>

## 1 Introduction
Our app makes managing grocery lists simple. Our intuitive UI makes it easy for users to add, delete, and check off different items with specific quantities on their list.


## 2 Process Description
*Process description as a set of activities; for each activity, provide the following:*

- *Activity name (verb or verb phrase)*
- *Activity description (concise paragraph)*
- *Entrance criteria (inputs needed for the activity)*
- *Exit criteria (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)*



- SearchItemName
- Searches the database to match what the item name that the user entered.
- Input: itemName
- Output: 

Do you think we need an activity for every function in our UML? Is that how this works?
